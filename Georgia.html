    <h1>Georgia</h1>

    <p>
        Georgia the Utopia! Welcome to our booth the Georgia. 
Well the country stand in the very place where it's little right up from Turkey, has Azerbaijan on right side down, down Armenia,  up Russia, so big:). 
It` also has the Black Sea on the left side. The weather there are almost similar to South Korea. Hot in 6~9 cold in 12~3. 
This is related with the Caucasian mountains. These huge region plays an important role by keeping the cold out coming from North.
Let's move on to products they produce. Have you heard of the place where wine started? As you guessed correctly, it's Georgia. 
It produces grape with 565 varieties and with them 500 kinds of wine.
This should be it for Georgia in brief, let talk more discussing the package product.</p>

<p>For those who likes activities, ski and swimming would be nice.
There is the Black Sea you could swim and when you turn around, there you go, a ski resort.
We stay in Batumi for 3days and fly to Tbilisi, stay there for one day for learning cultural and history of Georgia and for having the opportunity to souvenir(and of course some pretty wine). The next morning heading for ski mountain with a bus you will be carried to Gudauri ski resort. You will be staying there for 2days and take the night plane home.
</p>

<p>here is what we will do
    for there is no straight way to Georgia we will have to pass turkey airport and go.

    <p>but all these activities will be done on your choices. If you just want to swim you can do that.</p>
    actually it is good to do nothing

    <p>for food at Batumi I don't really know for good meals, so just seach some good food in the internet and go!

    <p>I also recommend just having fun by shopping with super cheap price in the local supermarket.<strike>Highly I do recommand<strike>
